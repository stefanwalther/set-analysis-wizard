This project has the following goals in mind:

* [X] Open source the code for the [existing Set Analysis Wizard](http://tools.qlikblog.at/SetAnalysisWizard/)
* [ ] Create a BNF parser to parse existing Set Analysis statements (see [https://github.com/stefanwalther/set-analysis-parser](https://github.com/stefanwalther/set-analysis-parser))
* [ ] Create a visualization extension for Qlik Sense, covering the existing functionality + implement tight integration leveraging the Client APIs of Qlik Sense

If you are interested in getting this solution or in participating, just follow this project here on GitHub, and you'll read more about my ~~summer~~ winter 2015 project very soon.
